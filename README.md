**How it works!**
Bloxflip Rain Catcher is a simple easy non-lag python script that joins all Bloxflip rains for you automatically. It opens up a chrome webbrowser then clicks the rain button accordingly.

This program is paid and obfuscated! Proof of it working is in the server also, I am open to live streaming it etc.
